# TextFX
TextFX is a Notepad++ plugin which performs a variety of common conversions on selected text.

# Obsoletion of TextFX
Currently, some plugins are taking over some areas where TextFX is being used:
  - Code alignment
  - NppConverter
  - XBrackets Lite
  - Tidy2

When the list grows long enough, it will become practical to bid farewell to an aging workhorse that has served the community well.

See http://docs.notepad-plus-plus.org/index.php/TextFX%27s_Future for above statement.

# GitHub fork
Regardless what's been said before, there are people who would like to continue using TextFX. As the project has been dead for 9 years, it was about time to do something about it.

Original source code for version 0.25 (dated 2008) can be fround from https://sourceforge.net/projects/npp-plugins/files/TextFX/. That code can be made to build on modern Visual Studio and it supports Unicode, but 64-bit build is impossible.

# Bugs

TextFX is distributed with Notepad++ but is not a part of Notepad++. Please do not post TextFX bugs in the Notepad++ bug tracker unless you believe the cause is Notepad++ and not TextFX.
