Changelog:
? means planned or partly done
* means a new feature added
+ means by request
"Special" versions are later than the shown version number. Special versions are quite safe to use except the latest additions may not function perfectly.
"prerelease" versions are earlier than the shown version number
Special and prerelease versions don't get any numerics to indicate which revision they are. 
If a bug is fixed, I'll identify which it may have caused: crashes or data corruption

+ TidyDLL updated to February/April 2006 (the dll provided at http://dev.int64.org/tidy.html should work but doesn't)
+ TextFX creates a separate root menu for itself
+ TextFX no longer searches for "Plugins" menu by name. 'Plugins' can be internationalized
