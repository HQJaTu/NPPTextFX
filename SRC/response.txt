>what about a translation? since FX is integrated in npp couldn't it be done in the nativelange.xml

Plugins would need access to the XML read/write code or to implement their own which is something I'm not ready for.

An update to NPPTextFX is available for testing. The only new feature is a ANSI & UNICODE multi-line Find&Replace dialog found in the Quick menu or Ctrl+R. This dialog is based on the F&R in Foxpro which is quite different than all the other ones which I consider to be fundamentally flawed. If you notice a missing feature that I haven't found from my editor collection or have forgotten from my forum readings, be sure to let me know.

There are a few notes:

* The history lists do not show proper UNICODE in Win98. If someone can show me how to get a ComboBoxEx32 to show up in a Win98 dialog, I'll fix it. This really doesn't matter since you can use arrow up/down to preview the history in the find or replace box. Some will just remember the right one by number.

* The RegEx list does not navigate with Up/Down unless you press Alt-Down first.

* The history lists allow you to put a UNICODE search into an ANSI dialog. I consider this to be your problem, not mine. This keeps history management simple and shouldn't bother anyone who understands UTF-8. 

* ANSI/UNICODE is only detected when the dialog is popped up. If you change the mode in the editor, you need to close and reopen the F&R dialog to change it's mode. If you have UTF-8 text stored then switch to an ANSI F&R, expect to see garbage.

* Scintilla does not allow multi-line RegEx so don't be surprised when it fails to find multi-line regex expressions.

* Unlike all the flawed F&R dialogs, this dialog box requires no other mini dialogs to be fully funtional. I hope this encourages people to use the modeless F&R the way it was meant to be used, up all the time instead of opening it only when needed. Notice that all of the most important controls are placed on the left side so it can be shoved most of the way off the screen and still be fully functional.

* Settings are preserved when disabled due to restrictions from other settings. When the restriction clears, the setting the user originally chose will be put back. This may be confusing at first since standard behaviour which I don't like simply destroys settings that must be disabled.

For example: If you select (*)Up then select [x]Regex, Up & Down are disabled and (*)Down is autoselected. When you unselect [ ]Regex, your original (*)Up setting is put back. If the user has chosen (*)Up, it will only be forced Down when restrictions require it.

* A special build of N++ 3.3 is included to make plugin dialogs function properly. If Escape, TAB, and Alt-Shortcut keys don't work then you haven't replaced Notepad++.exe. The technique used to support plugin dialogs will probably not be the one used in N++ 3.4 so this special release DLL is not expected to work with N++ 3.4. 

* Restore-Pos is a very important key so I'll show how to use it though I would normally write this into the demo file later. 1) You may want to search for something, copy it, and return to the original position to paste it. Restore-Pos will put the cursor back where the F&R box was started from. 2) You have marked text that you need to do more than one F&R on. Restore-Pos will remark the selection that was present when the F&R box was started.

So far I haven't found the need to implement two more keys to "Restore Pos" and "Obtain new position information" without closing the dialog.

* I do my own anchor management (anger management?) which automatically shifts for replaced text but not for manual undo or text alterations which will cause the start & end spots for [x]Wrap and [x]Selection to shift away from their expected position. Most of the time this shouldn't cause any problems.

* The TAB order is not an accident. It is designed to make every part of the dialog rapidly accessible via keyboard. You need to learn all the  ways to navigate a dialog box.
